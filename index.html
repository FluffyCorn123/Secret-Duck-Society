<h2 class="heading"> About Us</h2>

<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The secret duck society was founded in August of 2018. This society is about having fun and helping ducks and other animals. We have some rules/laws. They will not be listed here, because they are secret. But I can give a brief overview of them. First, these laws are not strict. Second, these laws are just about being kind to others and also respecting others. They are also about being honest. The other laws just specify what the society is about and what you need to do if you wish to no longer be part of the society&#40 Which we hope will not happen &#41.</p>
