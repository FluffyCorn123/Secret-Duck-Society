<h2 class="heading"> The Basics </h2>

<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This section is about ducks. This can be very useful. There are also links to other resources at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp First, "ducks" is a generic term. It does <em>not</em> refer to a specific species. It refers to the fact that it is a certain bird in the Anatidae family. However, not every bird in the Anatidae family is a duck. For example, swans and geese aren't ducks, even though they are in the same family. <br> <br>

<h2 class="heading"> How To Identify A Mallard</h2>

<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is how you can identify a the most common type of duck, the mallard. Mallards &#40 and all other ducks &#41 are smaller than their relatives, geese and swans. A male duck is called a drake &#40 first picture below &#41. They can be identified by their green head and their brown chest. A female duck is called a hen. They can be identified by their brown and white speckles. This helps them to blend in. This can be useful when a hen is at her nest protecting her eggs.</p>

<h2 class="heading">Molting</h2>

<p> When a drake mallard molts after mating in spring, he will look more like a hen, and it will be harder to tell them apart &#40 though it isn't impossible to tell them apart &#41. In the spring molting, also known as eclipse molting, they simultaneously lose all of their feathers. This leaves them flightless for a little bit. This can leave them vulnerable to predators during this time. In autumn, the drake molts again and regains his colorful feathers so the hens can choose which drake to mate with.</p>
